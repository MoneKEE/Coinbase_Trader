# Coupled-Oscillator-Analyzer

## Introduction

Welcome to the Stock Ticker Data Analysis and Prediction project! This repository contains code and resources for collecting stock ticker data, performing Fourier Transforms for feature extraction, and training a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model to predict buy, sell, and hold positions for stocks.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to analyze historical stock ticker data, decompose the waveform using Fourier Transforms to create additional features, and then use these features to make predictions on whether to buy, sell, or hold a particular stock. The project can be broken down into the following steps:

- Data Collection: Obtain historical stock ticker data for the desired stocks or indices.
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it's suitable for analysis.
- Feature Engineering: Apply Fourier Transforms to decompose the stock price waveform and create additional features.
- Model Architecture: Define the architecture of the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for prediction.
- Training: Train the MLP model on the preprocessed dataset.
- Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance and fine-tune it if necessary.
- Results: Share the predictions and insights obtained from the model.

## Dependencies

Before getting started, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
NumPy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebooks)

Follow the steps outlined in the project notebooks or scripts to perform data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. You can adapt and extend the code to suit your specific needs.

## Data Collection

To collect stock ticker data, you can use APIs like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or any other reliable data source. Ensure that the collected data includes historical price, volume, and other relevant information for the stocks you are interested in.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in any data analysis project. Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, outliers, and any other data inconsistencies. You may also need to normalize or scale the data for modeling purposes.

## Feature Engineering

Apply Fourier Transforms to decompose the stock price waveform and create additional features. These features should capture relevant information about the stock's price movement.

## Model Architecture

Define the architecture of your Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model for stock prediction. You can experiment with different network architectures and hyperparameters to optimize performance.

## Training

Train your MLP model on the preprocessed dataset. Monitor training metrics and consider implementing early stopping or other techniques to prevent overfitting.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualize the results to gain insights into the model's predictions.

## Results

Share the results of your analysis and model predictions. Discuss any findings, trends, or insights you've gained from the project. Consider including visualizations and explanations to make your results more accessible.
